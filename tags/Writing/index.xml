I had been aware of its existence for a while, but I had never bothered to check it out. What a mistake. R Markdown rocks! It&amp;rsquo;s hands down the easiest and most elegant method to creating rich documents that contain data analysis, figures, mathematical formulas, and text. And it&amp;rsquo;s super easy to learn. I wager that anybody who has RStudio installed can create a useful document in 30 minutes or less. So if you use R, and you&amp;rsquo;ve never used R Markdown, give it a try.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>R Markdown provides a literate programming platform for the R language. Literate programming, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">invented by Donald Knuth,&lt;/a> allows users to write both a program and a document describing the program, at the same time. In the case of R, this means that you can write a document that contains R code, the output that is generated when the R code is run (including graphs), and prose describing the R code and its output. To give you an example, I started writing a tutorial for R&amp;rsquo;s ggplot2 library this weekend, and the original R Markdown file as well as the HTML output generated from that file are &lt;a href="https://github.com/wilkelab/ggplot2_cookbook/blob/master/README.md">available here.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What does the word &lt;em>Markdown&lt;/em> stand for? &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown&lt;/a> is a minimalist approach to writing strutured documents. It consists of plain text with a few simple directives to mark sections, turn text bold or italics, or insert quotes. If you have ever edited a wikipedia article, you have used Markdown.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To give you an example, this is Markdown text:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>We can make text **bold**, *italics*, or `look like code.`
We can also insert links, [e.g. to wikipedia,](http://www.wikipedia.org/)
we can quote things:
&amp;gt; It is time to eat &amp;amp;#8212; Hungry John
or make lists:
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>It will be rendered like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>We can make text &lt;strong>bold&lt;/strong>, &lt;em>italics&lt;/em>, or &lt;code>look like code.&lt;/code> We can also insert links, &lt;a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">e.g. to wikipedia,&lt;/a> we can quote things:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It is time to eat â€” Hungry John&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>or make lists:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Item 1&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Item 2&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Item 3&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>R Markdown works the same, only that it adds the option to insert R code blocks. An R code block could look something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>```{r}
# place R code here, e.g. to make a plot:
library(ggplot2)
x &amp;lt;- 1:10; y &amp;lt;- x^2
qplot(x, y)
```
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>When you convert the R Markdown file to HTML, the R code gets executed, the R output captured and inserted into the document, and you&amp;rsquo;ve got everything nicely together, with very little work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To create an R Markdown document in RStudio, all you have to do is go to &lt;code>File&lt;/code>, &lt;code>New File&lt;/code>, and then select &lt;code>R Markdown&lt;/code>. Accept the default settings, and R Studio will generate a new R Markdown file with a few lines of example content. To convert the file into HTML, simply click on the &amp;ldquo;Knit HTML&amp;rdquo; button. If you have previously stored your R Markdown file somewhere on your harddisk (with suffix &lt;code>.Rmd&lt;/code>), RStudio will automatically save the generated HTML file in the same location, with the same name and suffix &lt;code>.html&lt;/code>. The HTML file is self-contained, including all images, so it&amp;rsquo;s easy to publish it on a web page or share it with people. RStudio also provides you with the option to publish the document online on the &lt;a href="http://rpubs.com/">RPubs&lt;/a> website. Just click on the &amp;ldquo;Publish&amp;rdquo; button in the HTML view.&lt;/p>
