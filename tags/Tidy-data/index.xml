&lt;p>It seems that Hadley Wickham, the author of the spectacular &lt;a href="http://ggplot2.org/">ggplot2&lt;/a> library for R, is not content with revolutionizing the world of computational data analysis just once. He keeps doing it. This spring, he released the &lt;a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html">dplyr&lt;/a> package, a package that proposes a grammar of data manipulation. I predict that dplyr will become as important for large-scale data analysis and manipulation as ggplot2 has become for visualization. If you like ggplot2, you will love dplyr.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1">&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>dplyr is the next iteration of the popular plyr package, only that it is 100 times faster and way more intuitive. It provides a clean interface to work with data sets that are “tidy.” (See also my previous two blog posts on tidy data &lt;a href="https://sevimcengiz.github.io/blog/2014/7/20/keep-your-data-tidy">here&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://sevimcengiz.github.io/blog/2014/7/21/keep-your-data-tidy-part-ii">here.&lt;/a>) Let me whet your appetite by showing you a simple analysis I did the other day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to find out how much evolutionary divergence there is between human genes and the corresponding yeast (&lt;em>S. cerevisiae&lt;/em>) orthologs. Specifically, I was interested in the range of sequence identities among genes, i.e., what are the most conserved genes, the most diverged genes, what is the mean divergence, and so on. The analysis has an additional twist in that there are different types of ortholog pairs. There are one-to-one orthologs, where the human gene has exactly one counter-part in the yeast genome, there are one-to-many orthologs, where the gene in one organism has multiple counter-parts in the other organism, and there are many-to-many orthologs, where there are multiple genes in both organisms that are orthologous to each other. Thus, I wanted to carry out my analysis by orthology type.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went to &lt;a href="http://www.ensembl.org/index.html">ensembl&lt;/a> and downloaded all human-to-yeast orthologs with their respective sequence identities. The resulting csv file is available &lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/97817736/human_yeast_divergence.csv">here.&lt;/a> We can download this file directly into R, using the RCurl package. We’ll also load the dplyr package, since we’ll need it later:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre class="r">&lt;code>library(RCurl)
library(dplyr)
url &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/97817736/human_yeast_divergence.csv&amp;quot;
data &amp;lt;- read.csv(textConnection(getURL(url)))&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Let’s take a look at the data. There are five columns, the gene id for the human gene, the gene id for the
corresponding yeast ortholog, the homology type (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many), the percent identity with respect to both the human (&lt;code>perc.ident.human&lt;/code>) and the yeast (&lt;code>perc.ident.yeast&lt;/code>) gene, and a confidence score that tells us how confident we are that the two genes are actually orthologous.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre class="r">&lt;code>head(data)&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> human.gene.ID yeast.gene.ID homology.type perc.ident.human
1 ENSG00000100077 YKL126W ortholog_many2many 19
2 ENSG00000100077 YHR205W ortholog_many2many 18
3 ENSG00000100077 YMR104C ortholog_many2many 18
4 ENSG00000196139 YHR104W ortholog_one2many 33
5 ENSG00000173213 YFL037W ortholog_one2many 71
6 ENSG00000154930 YLR153C ortholog_many2many 43
perc.identity.yeast confidence
1 19 1
2 15 1
3 18 1
4 33 1
5 69 1
6 44 1 &lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now we’re ready for some dplyr magic. Let’s assume we want to analyze the data by homology type, and we want to find the minimum, mean, median, and maximum sequence identity for each homology type, as well as the standard deviation of the identity distribution. All this can be achieved with the following code:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre class="r">&lt;code>data %&amp;gt;% group_by(homology.type) %&amp;gt;%
summarize(
min=min(perc.ident.human),
mean=mean(perc.ident.human),
std.dev=sd(perc.ident.human),
max=max(perc.ident.human))&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Source: local data frame [3 x 5]
homology.type min mean std.dev max
1 ortholog_many2many 1 26.36965 16.37955 92
2 ortholog_one2many 0 27.46243 15.18146 86
3 ortholog_one2one 1 33.04183 12.89296 80&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The function &lt;code>group_by()&lt;/code> states that we want to carry out the analysis separately for each homology type, and the function &lt;code>summarize()&lt;/code> calculates the summary statistics (min, mean, etc.) for each group. The operator &lt;code>%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code> is a chaining operator, like a pipe in the UNIX command line. It takes the output from the previous operation and feeds it into the subsequence operation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can see, dplyr syntax focuses entirely on the logical flow of the data analysis. You don’t ever have to worry about bookkeeping, looping over cases, or details of the data storage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s do another example. Let’s say we’re only interested in one-to-one orthologs, and we want to find the top 10 least diverged yeast genes and list them in descending order. The following lines achieve this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre class="r">&lt;code>data %&amp;gt;% filter(homology.type==&amp;#39;ortholog_one2one&amp;#39;) %&amp;gt;%
select(yeast.gene.ID, human.gene.ID, perc.ident.human) %&amp;gt;%
top_n(10) %&amp;gt;%
arrange(desc(perc.ident.human))&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Selecting by perc.ident.human
yeast.gene.ID human.gene.ID perc.ident.human
1 YLR167W ENSG00000143947 80
2 YDR064W ENSG00000110700 77
3 YKL145W ENSG00000161057 75
4 YOR210W ENSG00000177700 75
5 YGL048C ENSG00000087191 74
6 YPL086C ENSG00000134014 74
7 YPR016C ENSG00000242372 72
8 YJR121W ENSG00000110955 72
9 YDL007W ENSG00000100764 71
10 YEL027W ENSG00000185883 70 &lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The function &lt;code>filter()&lt;/code> selects all rows of the given homology type, the function &lt;code>select()&lt;/code> picks the specific columns we are interested in, the function &lt;code>top_n()&lt;/code> selects the top &lt;em>n&lt;/em> values in the last data column (i.e., column &lt;code>perc.ident.human&lt;/code> in this example), and the function &lt;code>arrange()&lt;/code> sorts the data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If these examples have piqued your interest and you want to learn more, I recommend you start by reading the dplyr vignette, which you can find here: &lt;a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html">http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html&lt;/a>&lt;br />
There is also an excellent introduction by Kevin Markham, with accompanying 40 minute video, available here: &lt;a href="http://rpubs.com/justmarkham/dplyr-tutorial">http://rpubs.com/justmarkham/dplyr-tutorial&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And have I mentioned already that dplyr has a &lt;a href="http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/databases.html">database backend,&lt;/a> so you can now easily use all the statistical sophistication that R provides on arbitrarily large, remotely stored data sets.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="footnotes">

&lt;ol>
&lt;li id="fn1">&lt;p>And if you aren’t familiar with &lt;a href="http://ggplot2.org/">ggplot2,&lt;/a> spend some time with it. It is fantastic, though it may feel alien initially. If you’re used to traditional visualization approaches, you may think in terms of drawing points and lines onto a canvas. ggplot2 requires you to approach visualization in a completely different way, in terms of mapping features of the data onto aesthetic features of the graph. Once you get this way of thinking, it becomes rather powerful.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>

&lt;script src="https://sevimcengiz.github.io/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>My previous post on &lt;a href="https://sevimcengiz.github.io/blog/2014/7/20/keep-your-data-tidy">tidy data&lt;/a> didn’t at all touch on rule 3, “Each type of observational unit forms a table.” The example I gave had only one observational unit, the weekly temperature measurements. Frequently, however, we have data corresponding to multiple observational units. In this case, it is important that we store them in separate tables, and that we know how to combine these tables for useful analyses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, we need to figure out when we’re dealing with multiple observational units and when we are not. An observational unit is the base unit on which measurements are done. Importantly, multiple measurements can be performed on the same unit. For example, if we’re studying a group of patients, and for each patient we measure height, weight, heart rate, and blood pressure, then the observational unit is the patient, and we are measuring four variables per observational unit. However, if we’re following the patients over time, and we make those four measurements once every month for a year, then the observational units are the patient-months, i.e., we have one observational unit per patient each month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In what follows, I’m assuming you have read the &lt;a href="https://sevimcengiz.github.io/blog/2014/7/20/keep-your-data-tidy">previous post&lt;/a> and you are familiar with the temperature example I made there. In this example, since we’re measuring temperature each week, we have one observational unit per city per week. If in addition to temperature we also measured humidity, then we’d have two measurements per observational unit but the number and type of observational units wouldn’t change. Now, however, assume that we’re also recording additional information about the cities that we’re studying, for example their altitude. The altitude will be the same every week. Therefore, altitude is a property of the city, not of the city-week that is the experimental unit for the temperature measurements. Thus, we now have two separate sets of experimental units, the city-weeks for which we measure temperature and the cities themselves for which we measure altitude.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By rule 3 for tidy data, the altitude measurements do not belong into the table that contains temperature data, they belong into a separate table. For example, this table could look like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;gt; alt.data
city altitude
1 A 2300
2 B 400
3 C 250&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Let’s assume that we want to know whether there is a relationship between the mean temperature for a city and the city’s altitude. How would we do this? First, we calculate the mean temperature, as before, and store it in a new data frame called &lt;code>mean.temp&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;gt; mean.temp &amp;lt;- ddply(temp.data, &amp;quot;city&amp;quot;, summarize, mean.temp=mean(temperature))
&amp;gt; mean.temp
city mean.temp
1 A 13.50
2 B 20.25
3 C 23.75&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now, we need to merge the two data frames &lt;code>alt.data&lt;/code> and &lt;code>mean.temp&lt;/code>. This can be done with the function &lt;code>join()&lt;/code> from the plyr package, or alternatively with the function &lt;code>merge&lt;/code> from base R:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;gt; city.data &amp;lt;- join(mean.temp, alt.data)
Joining by: city
&amp;gt; city.data
city mean.temp altitude
1 A 13.50 2300
2 B 20.25 400
3 C 23.75 250&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now we can investigate the relationship between the two variables, for example by fitting a linear model:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;gt; summary(lm(altitude ~ mean.temp, data = city.data))
Call:
lm(formula = altitude ~ mean.temp, data = city.data)
Residuals:
1 2 3
121.1 -354.8 233.6
Coefficients:
Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&amp;gt;|t|)
(Intercept) 5027.01 1177.01 4.271 0.146
mean.temp -210.97 59.95 -3.519 0.176
Residual standard error: 441.7 on 1 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared: 0.9253, Adjusted R-squared: 0.8506
F-statistic: 12.38 on 1 and 1 DF, p-value: 0.1763&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Both the &lt;code>join&lt;/code> and the &lt;code>merge&lt;/code> function can handle much more complicated situations. For example, by default, both functions merge on all shared variables. Further, you can specify how you want to handle the situation when cases are missing. A “left” join keeps all rows from the first data frame and matches the corresponding ones from the second, a “right” join keeps all rows from the second data frame and matches the corresponding ones from the first, an “inner” join only keeps rows that exist in both data frames, and a “full” join keeps all observations that exist in either data frame. For more details, read the documentation of either function.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Keep your data tidy</title><link>https://sevimcengiz.github.io/blog/2014/07/20/keep-your-data-tidy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sevimcengiz.github.io/blog/2014/07/20/keep-your-data-tidy/</guid><description>
&lt;script src="https://sevimcengiz.github.io/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>I came across this nice preprint by Hadley Wickham:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Hadley Wickham (2014). &lt;a href="http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf">Tidy data.&lt;/a> Submitted.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In this preprint, Wickham describes a way of organizing data he calls “tidy.” He then argues that tidy data and tidy tools (that both input and output tidy data) make data analysis much more efficient than any alternative approach can.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When are data tidy? When they satisfy these three conditions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
&lt;li>Each variable forms a column.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Each observation forms a row.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Each type of observational unit forms a table.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Every other arrangement of data is called “messy.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s look at an example. Assume you’re making temperature measurements once a week in three cities (city A, city B, and city C). Instinctively, most people would probably record the data like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>week city_A city_B city_C
1 14 18 23
2 15 21 24
3 12 25 23
4 13 17 25
...&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Or maybe even like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>week 1 2 3 4 ...
city_A 14 15 12 13
city_B 18 21 25 17
city_C 23 24 23 25&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>While both options may look quite organized, neither corresponds to tidy data. In both cases, Wickham’s rules 1 and 2 are violated. For example, in the first case, the variable &lt;code>temperature&lt;/code> appears in three columns. Consequently, multiple observations appear in each row. In the second case, multiple variables appear in each column and multiple observations appear in each row.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tidy version of this data set would look like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>week city temperature
1 A 14
1 B 18
1 C 23
2 A 15
2 B 21
2 C 24
...
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>I believe that most people have an instinctive dislike towards tidy data, because tidy data sets tend to have many rows and are difficult to read with the human eye. You can clearly see this in my made-up data set. The messy&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1">&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>&lt;/a> versions allow us to quickly compare cities’ temperatures in different weeks as well as identify trends over time. The tidy version does not. It also requires many more rows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nevertheless, for computational analysis, having tidy data makes things way more efficient, &lt;em>if you have the right set of tools.&lt;/em> These tools need to consistently input and output tidy data. Fortunately, these tools exist in R. (And Wickham has greatly enhanced R’s capability to keep analyses tidy by writing the packages reshape2, plyr, and ggplot2.) With the appropriate tools, even quite complicated analyses can be expressed in just a few lines of code. And most importantly, there is no need for explicit loops or other bookkeeping code. You just express the semantics of your analysis and the programming language does the rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How does this work? In general, when we want to analyze data, we want to manipulate (specifically filter, transform, aggregate, and sort), model, and visualize. These steps require only a handful of generic tools, such as a generic data aggregation function. Let me show you a few examples, using the &lt;code>summarize()&lt;/code> and &lt;code>ddply()&lt;/code> functions from the plyr package. I assume we store the temperature data in tidy form in a data frame called &lt;code>temp.data&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;gt; temp.data
week city temperature
1 1 A 14
2 1 B 18
3 1 C 23
4 2 A 15
5 2 B 21
6 2 C 24
7 3 A 12
8 3 B 25
9 3 C 23
10 4 A 13
11 4 B 17
12 4 C 25&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Let’s calculate the mean temperature in each city:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;gt; ddply(temp.data, &amp;quot;city&amp;quot;, summarize, mean=mean(temperature))
city mean
1 A 13.50
2 B 20.25
3 C 23.75&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Or in each week:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;gt; ddply(temp.data, &amp;quot;week&amp;quot;, summarize, mean=mean(temperature))
week mean
1 1 18.33333
2 2 20.00000
3 3 20.00000
4 4 18.33333&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Or let’s find the city with the highest temperature each week:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;gt; ddply(temp.data, &amp;quot;week&amp;quot;, summarize, hottest.city=city[which.max(temperature)])
week hottest.city
1 1 C
2 2 C
3 3 B
4 4 C&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>These are just a few simple examples. For more examples, read Wickham’s paper, and also read his paper on plyr.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2">&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Does any of this matter? I’m sure somebody will tell me: Yeah, but R is an ugly and archaic programming language, and my python code will analyze the data tables that Wickham calls “messy” just fine. My answer is that it only matters if you care about how much time you spend analyzing your data. Read through the example analysis Wickham provides in his Section 5 (“Case study”). This analysis uses less than 30 lines of code, including the code for visualization, to identify and plot causes of death with unusual temporal patterns throughout the day (see his Fig. 4). How many lines of code would you have written to do a comparable analysis? And how long would it have taken you to write this code and debug it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At some point, a quantitative advantage becomes a qualitative one. While one can do the exact same analyses with tidy and messy datasets/tools, the tidy approach will generally require much less code, and hence be faster to write, easier to debug, and easier to modify/maintain. In practice, this means that the person using the tidy approach will be able to analyze more data sets, try a larger number of different analysis approaches, and/or make fewer mistakes. Aggregated over the course of several months, this advantage can easily translate into some major new findings made only by the person using the tidy approach.&lt;/p>
