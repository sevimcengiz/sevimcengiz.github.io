&lt;p>I’m very excited to announce my latest project, a book on data visualization. The working title is “Fundamentals of Data Visualization”. The book will be published with O’Reilly, and a preview is &lt;a href="https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/">available here.&lt;/a> The entire book is written in R Markdown, and the figures are made with ggplot2. The source for the book is &lt;a href="https://github.com/clauswilke/dataviz">available on github.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even though the entire book is written in R Markdown, it is not a book on programming. The book is meant as a guide to making visualizations that accurately reflect the data, tell a story, and look professional. It has grown out of my experience of working with students and postdocs in my laboratory on thousands of data visualizations. Over the years, I have noticed that the same issues arise over and over. I have attempted to collect my accumulated knowledge from these interactions in the form of this book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As of this writing, approximately half of the planned chapters are completed, and all completed chapters are available online. I will post future chapters as they become available. Since this is a work in progress, not everything may be completely finalized, and I may rewrite some of the posted chapters at a later date. I welcome feedback. If you see any errors or other problems, please &lt;a href="https://github.com/clauswilke/dataviz/issues">open an issue on github.&lt;/a> If you have suggestions for other topics to cover, or for datasets that would work well for certain chapters, please also feel free to record these suggestions as issues on github.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With very few exceptions, all figures in the book are generated straight from ggplot2, with no manual post-processing in photoshop or illustrator. (At present, the only exception is two figures in the chapter on &lt;a href="https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/image-file-formats.html">image file formats.&lt;/a>) Therefore, the book also serves as a showcase of what ggplot2 can do. I am using the bleeding edge of ggplot2 software development, though. To reproduce all the figures in the book, you may have to install current development versions of several R packages.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Goodbye joyplots</title><link>https://sevimcengiz.github.io/blog/2017/09/15/goodbye-joyplots/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sevimcengiz.github.io/blog/2017/09/15/goodbye-joyplots/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Anybody who has been paying any attention to the data visualization scene knows that the summer of 2017 was the summer of joyplots. This type of visualization turned viral, probably not in small part fueled by the R package &lt;a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggjoy">ggjoy&lt;/a> that I wrote in July. However, I think it’s time to retire both the name “joyplot” and the ggjoy package, and as of today the ggjoy package is officially deprecated. A replacement package &lt;a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggridges">ggridges&lt;/a> is in place and provides essentially the same functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The term “joyplot” was coined by Jenny Bryan in a tweet on April 24, 2017:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">
I hereby propose that we call these “joy plots” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash">#rstats&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/uuLGpQLAwY">https://t.co/uuLGpQLAwY&lt;/a>

&lt;p>The idea was to honor the band Joy Division, whose 1979 album &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_Pleasures">&lt;em>Unknown Pleasures&lt;/em>&lt;/a> features on its cover a visualization of radio waves as staggered lines, creating a 3D-like effect. This seemed like a good idea and the name caught on like wildfire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, when the name “joyplot” took off, nobody in the datascience community was aware of the origin of the name “Joy Division”. As described in the book &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Dolls">&lt;em>House of Dolls,&lt;/em>&lt;/a> joy divisions were groups of Jewish women in Nazi concentration camps kept for the sexual pleasure of soldiers. The band Joy Division took their name directly from this book and even quoted from the book in one of their early songs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus, as joyful as the name “joyplot” sounds to the uninformed, its history is rather dark, and we would do better using a different name. For this reason, I have decided to now call these plots “ridgeline plots”. Indeed, from day one, the ggjoy package contained a &lt;code>geom_ridgeline()&lt;/code>, so I’m just keeping in this tradition. The new ggridges package uses this naming convention throughout, and all functions have been renamed accordingly. For example, &lt;code>geom_joy()&lt;/code> is now called &lt;code>geom_density_ridges()&lt;/code>. A complete list of all name replacements is provided &lt;a href="https://github.com/clauswilke/ggjoy/blob/master/README.md">here&lt;/a>. Porting your code from ggjoy to ggridges should be as simple as a search-and-replace for all those functions in your code. If you run into any trouble, please let me know or open an &lt;a href="https://github.com/clauswilke/ggridges/issues">issue on github&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>cowplot R package now available on CRAN</title><link>https://sevimcengiz.github.io/blog/2015/06/04/cowplot-r-package-now-available-on-cran/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sevimcengiz.github.io/blog/2015/06/04/cowplot-r-package-now-available-on-cran/</guid><description>

&lt;p>This week, I finally took the time to clean up the code for my cowplot R package and &lt;a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/index.html">submit it to CRAN.&lt;/a> While the code had been up on &lt;a href="https://github.com/wilkelab/cowplot">github for a while,&lt;/a> and I had &lt;a href="https://sevimcengiz.github.io/blog/2014/10/7/to-grid-or-not-to-grid">blogged about it previously,&lt;/a> nobody had really taken notice as far as I can tell. However, this time, with an official release and better documentation, people seem to like it a lot. The response on Twitter was overwhelming.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It argues that we can do better than showing data as bars of mean height with error bars indicating standard deviations. In my lab, we use many of the proposed techniques already, see e.g. Fig. 4 in &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/articles/211/">this paper.&lt;/a> However, I’m glad that I now have a simple reference I can point people to when I want them to reconsider their figures.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>To grid or not to grid</title><link>https://sevimcengiz.github.io/blog/2014/10/07/to-grid-or-not-to-grid/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sevimcengiz.github.io/blog/2014/10/07/to-grid-or-not-to-grid/</guid><description>

&lt;p>I had a twitter discussion with ggplot2 author &lt;a href="http://had.co.nz/">Hadley Wickham&lt;/a> on whether or not to include a grid background in plots. He thinks the default should have a grid, I think the opposite. I believe we both agree that grids make sense for some plots and not for others, so this is just a question about defaults. On that issue, we remain in disagreement.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One of my preferred methods of data visualization is to take two variables that measure the same quantity in different ways or different systems and then plot one versus the other. As an example, see &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3678335/figure/RSTB20120334F3/">this figure&lt;/a> from a paper my lab published last year. In this kind of a plot, a grid would be highly distracting. In general, I like to add guiding lines that highlight specific features of the data. For example, if the most important feature in the data is whether &lt;em>y&lt;/em> values fall above or below one, then placing a horizontal line at &lt;em>y&lt;/em> = 1 would be a good idea, and it would likely be more helpful than a generic grid covering the entire plot. However, I do agree that if one does a lot of &lt;a href="http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Facets_(ggplot2)">faceting,&lt;/a> a grid may be necessary. In fact, yesterday I played around with faceted plots without background grid, and I noticed that they had a tendency to fall apart and not look very convincing. Without grid, the eye has little to go by in these plots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, if I can see the value of a background grid in some cases, why am I not convinced that it is the right default? When it comes to constructing plots, I fundamentally believe in an additive rather than a subtractive model. That is, start with a plot that is as empty as possible, and then add everything you need until you have a clear and informative graph. In a subtractive model, you would start with all sorts of additional visual elements of which you remove those you don’t need. While both approaches can lead to the same end result, it is my experience from ~15 years of supervising students, and from reviewing oodles of papers with poor-quality figures, that most people don’t remove visual noise from a graph unless explicitly prompted to do so. If ggplot2 places a gray background grid, then a gray background grid it is. Therefore, in my &lt;a href="https://github.com/wilkelab/cowplot">own personal plotting package,&lt;/a> whose intended purpose is internal use in my lab, the default is no background grid. I’d rather say on occasion “please add a background grid to this figure” than having to repeat over and over “please remove the background grid.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ten simple rules for reproducible computational research</title><link>https://sevimcengiz.github.io/blog/2013/10/26/ten-simple-rules-for-reproducible-computational-research/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sevimcengiz.github.io/blog/2013/10/26/ten-simple-rules-for-reproducible-computational-research/</guid><description>

&lt;p>PLOS Computational Biology just published a new addition to their popular &lt;a href="https://collections.plos.org/ten-simple-rules">“ten simple rules”&lt;/a> series:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Sandve GK, Nekrutenko A, Taylor J, Hovig E (2013) Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Computational Research. PLoS Comput Biol 9(10): e1003285. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285">doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This article is relevant to anybody who wants to do computational research. I’ll make it required reading in my lab. For every single one of these rules, I can think of projects I’ve been involved with&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1">&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>&lt;/a> that ran into trouble or failed because they violated that rule.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While all of the rules are important, I’m particularly partial to these four: avoid manual data manipulation, record all intermediate results, always store raw data behind plots, and provide public access to scripts and results. They will prevent a lot of headaches for both you and the people coming after you who’d like to build on your results.&lt;/p>

&lt;script src="https://sevimcengiz.github.io/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>If I were king of the world, I would decree that every man or woman who releases a software product, for pay or for honor, with the purpose of graphing data, shall, upon pain of death, ensure that the default axis labels, axis tick labels, and legends are printed at a reasonable size, legible to your aging king’s declining eyesight. However, because I would be a fair and wise king, I would also decree that every such man or woman have a one-month grace period to bring their software into compliance. Without such a grace period, I’m afraid all authors of currently available graphing software would have to instantly lose their heads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been in science for almost 20 years, and I have used and seen used a myriad of different graphing programs. When I was a grad student, gnuplot was all the rage. As a postdoc, I mostly used xmgrace. These days, I rarely make figures myself, but my students use everything from R with various plotting libraries, python with matplotlib, to MATLAB and even Mathematica. (As an aside, MATLAB and Mathematica, the commercial products, are both strong contenders for ugliest default graphics, by a wide margin. Apparently neither of the parent companies can afford to employ a graphical designer.) NONE of these programs use sane defaults for axis labels. They don’t use sane defaults for other things either, but this post is about axis labels.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="figure">&lt;span id="fig:figure1">&lt;/span>
&lt;img src="2013-09-10-test.png" alt="Scatter plot created in R, using the functions pdf() and plot() with default options." width="60%" />
&lt;p class="caption">
Figure 1: Scatter plot created in R, using the functions &lt;code>pdf()&lt;/code> and &lt;code>plot()&lt;/code> with default options.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Getting axis labels right shouldn’t be that hard. Figures usually appear in print at a width of about 3” to 5.5” (depending on whether they span one or two columns in a typical two-column layout). So, when you scale down the figure to that size, the font should be at a reasonable size, somewhere in the range of 10pt–12pt. Make it 9pt at 3” for your default settings, and you’ll never be terribly off. How hard can it be? Very hard, apparently. Try it out: Take your favorite plotting program, make a simple graph, say an x–y scatter plot using default settings, then scale the resulting figure to 3” and see if the labels are at a suitable size. If I do this in R, I get the result shown in Figure &lt;a href="#fig:figure1">1&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There’s more things that are wrong with this figure than just axis labels, but axis labels is what I’m focusing on here. Clearly they are too small. I bet you’ll get the same result in your favorite plotting program. By default, virtually all plotting programs I’m aware of make axis labels way too small.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what is going on here? First, I doubt that the people writing plotting software are experienced scientists who have prepared thousands of publication-quality figures. So maybe they just don’t know any better. Second, and more importantly, I believe the culprit is screen preview. Take the same figure, blow it up to a width of 20” on a modern, high-resolution monitor, and the axis labels look just fine. In fact, if you take a figure with properly sized axis labels and blow it up to 20”, the axis labels look outright scary. I can totally understand how somebody who has only ever looked at graphs on screen would feel uncomfortable making fonts bigger. Unfortunately, we the consumers of plotting software will generally have to produce figures to be used in print, and thus we have to scale the fonts to an appropriate size, even if it scares us. Apparently the authors of said software don’t have the guts to do so.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
