&lt;p>The majority of people on a diet will tell you that they’re dieting because they want to lose weight.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1">&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>&lt;/a> If you ask them &lt;em>why&lt;/em> they want to lose weight, you’ll hear things like “I don’t want to have a heart attack at 50” or “I have some extra flab” or “I want to get rid of my spare tire” or “I want a six pack.” So people want to be healthy, or they want to look good naked, or both. Importantly, though, none of these goals have much to do with weight &lt;em>per se.&lt;/em> What people are actually concerned with is excess fat. And we generally know this, of course. We know that when we say somebody is overweight we really mean the person is overfat. Yet, in day-to-day practice, we don’t use the word “overfat,” we keep saying “overweight.” And as a result, we keep confusing weight and fat, and more importantly, we use the wrong metrics to keep track of our dieting success.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ask anybody on a diet how they’re keeping track of their progress, and the answer you’ll hear most frequently is going to be “I weigh myself regularly.” There we have a major problem. People want to lose fat, but they keep track of their progress using a metric that inherently cannot distinguish between desirable (i.e., lean) and undesirable (i.e., fat) mass. As a consequence, they’re setting themselves up for failure. They may indeed lose weight but this weight loss may not be accompanied by the desired improvements in physique and health.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2">&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The flawed metric of weight leads to such terrible TV shows as “The biggest loser,” which promote awful dieting advice. If you make it your goal to lose as much weight as possible in as little time as possible, you’ll inevitably burn off a lot of muscle mass. And that’s terribly sad, in my mind. The one thing every obese person has going for them is that they have a substantial amount of muscle under their layer of fat, from all the extra weight they’re carrying around all the time. Strip away the fat and keep the muscle, and you’ll have a strong, healthy person. But burn the muscle alongside the fat, and you’ll end up with a skinny-fat person. This person would now have to embark on a process of regaining (lean) mass, which will be psychologically terrifying and will usually not happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point, I should probably demonstrate that there is indeed a substantive difference between losing fat and losing weight. Enter one of my &lt;a href="http://crossfitnewengland.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/fat-vs-muscle.jpg">favorite pictures&lt;/a> on the internet. (&lt;strong>Warning:&lt;/strong> mildly NSFW, woman in underwear.) It shows how the same person can look visibly slimmer and more toned after gaining a substantial amount of weight, if that weight comes in the form of lean mass not fat. The reason for this dramatic difference is that muscle is substantially more dense than fat. You need &lt;em>a lot&lt;/em> of muscle to fill a decent volume of space, and that muscle is going to weigh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If weight is a bad metric for fat-loss progress, how can you know whether you’re on track with your diet? Let’s first go over all the other commonly used methods that also don’t work:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
&lt;li>&lt;p>Assessing body-fat bia bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA). Many scales these days have BIA built in as well. When you step on the scales, they show you not only how much you weigh but also what your body-fat percentage is. Only that this number can be quite inaccurate. BIA results depend on numerous factors, not the least of which is your hydration status which may change daily. You can find a more detailed discussion of this issue &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioelectrical_impedance_analysis">here.&lt;/a> The one-sentence summary is that you shouldn’t track your fat-loss progress with a BIA device, and in particular not with regular scales that have BIA built in.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;p>Looking at your abs in the mirror. This doesn’t work because it’s easy to trick yourself into thinking you’re doing great when actually you’re not. Even more likely is the opposite, though: You may think nothing much is happening when actually you have changed a lot. Fundamentally, this method is not sufficiently quantitative. You can never really be sure whether things have actually changed and by how much.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;p>Pinching your belly fat. This method is also surprisingly unreliable, in particular when you’re getting lean. As you’re leaning out, your skin gets looser and you can pinch from a larger area, seemingly being able to pinch more at a time. This effect is particularly pronounced when you’re pinching from top and bottom. Try pinching your belly fat right underneath your navel, either from top and bottom or from left and right. Do you see the difference? Also, sometimes we can have a substantial layer of fat but can’t pinch it. For example, try to pinch the fat on top of your thigh. Can you do that? Chances are, if you can you’re pretty lean. For most people, the fat on the thighs doesn’t really separate from the muscles, and as they lean out it separates more easily.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>One method that works reasonably well is &lt;a href="http://www.edb.utexas.edu/fit/bodycompfit.php">dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA),&lt;/a> basically a low-dose X ray. It’s the same method that is used to measure bone density. While it’s a great way to keep track of your body composition over time, it’s also cumbersome, expensive, requires professional equipment, and exposes your body to unnecessary X rays. Not something you want to do once a week.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3">&lt;sup>3&lt;/sup>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other method that works is super cheap, easy, and reliable: get a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/AccuFitness-MT05-MyoTape-Body-Measure/dp/B000G7YW7Y/">$5 tape measure&lt;/a> and measure your waist circumference (just at the height of the belly button). That measurement should go down over time if you’re progressing successfully. How do you know you’re not losing lean mass at the same time? Your strength should stay the same or go up. If you’re increasingly &lt;a href="https://sevimcengiz.github.io/blog/2013/10/1/why-i-lift-weights-and-so-should-you">lifting heavier weights&lt;/a> while your waistline is slimming, you can be pretty certain that everything is on track. And if you happen to keep track of your weight at the same time, you may notice that your weight is going up even as your waist circumference is going down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So in the future, don’t plan to lose weight, plan to lose fat. And lose that fat while keeping as much of your weight as you can, maybe even increase your weight by a few pounds!&lt;/p>

&lt;li id="fn1">&lt;p>As incredulous as it may sound, there are indeed some people who are on a diet to &lt;em>gain&lt;/em> weight.

&lt;li id="fn2">&lt;p>It’s important to realize that people can weigh little and nevertheless have poor metabolic health.

&lt;li id="fn3">&lt;p>It probably also isn’t sensitive enough to measure changes week by week. But doing a DEXA scan once a year might not be a bad idea.&lt;a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩︎&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>

&lt;script src="https://sevimcengiz.github.io/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>For the first forty years of my life, I thought lifting weights was for meatheads. If you lifted weights, my thinking went, you cared more about your looks than your health or fitness level. Actually, not looks even, just sheer size. I was convinced that my fitness regimen of endurance training (running, cycling, walking), flexibility (yoga), and basic whole-body movements (more yoga) was far superior to stupidly lifting weights in a gym. I mean, look at those guys&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1">&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>&lt;/a> in the gym: they take a barbell, lift it five times, and then they take a five minute break. Do they even break a sweat? I don’t call that exercise, I call that sitting around on your lazy behind. Only when I started to read up on exercise physiology did I realize that lifting heavy is an extremely beneficial activity. Further, it is likely the most important type of exercise we can engage in, in particular as we grow older. And those five-minute breaks are absolutely necessary if you’re doing it right, in particular if you care more for strength than size.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before I continue, though, a word of clarification: While the title of this post says “lift weights,” what really matters is that one engages in resistance training, i.e., putting heavy loads onto the muscles, tendons, and bones. Conventional resistance training involves barbell work, e.g. the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JOqwynLV1w">barbell squat&lt;/a> or the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQi8xUZ0V90">deadlift&lt;/a>. However, other forms of exercise can be resistance training as well. For example, there are many excellent bodyweight resistance exercises. If you’re regularly cranking out &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw0kXtvOpfU">planche pushups&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlASvQCD4lY">one-arm chins&lt;/a>, or &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5orjYQupmWo">one-arm handstands&lt;/a>, you probably don’t have to pick up a barbell anytime soon. To find out whether a particular exercise can be considered resistance training &lt;em>for you&lt;/em>, find out how many repetitions you could do at most. If you can’t do more than about eight to ten repetitions, you’re in the resistance range. For example, if the max number of pushups you can do in one go is four, pushups are a viable resistance exercise for you. But if you can easily crank out twenty, pushups are an endurance exercise for you and you have to move on to something harder for resistance work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img style="float: right; width: 50%; margin-left: 1em;" src="2013-10-01_143502.jpg">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So why should you do resistance training? First, only heavy resistance training can actually activate and train all muscle fibers, including the strongest fast-twitch fibers. If you go jogging for 30 minutes, even at a pretty fast pace, you may feel tired afterwards, your legs may even be sore, but a substantial fraction of your leg muscle hasn’t actually done anything. By comparison, a single set of five barbell squats, at a weight that you can lift only about five times in a row, will have hit nearly every single muscle fiber in your leg muscles. Thus, you get way more exercise bang for your buck. (Incidentally, that’s why you need a few minutes break between sets of heavy resistance training. The exercises truly are that exhausting.) Second, there is better transfer from strength to endurance than the other way round. Once you have strength, it’s relatively easy to build endurance on top. But just because you have endurance doesn’t mean you can easily add strength. In simple terms, if you can do a one-arm pushup, you could easily acquire the ability to do 50 regular pushups in a row. On the flip side, being able to do 50 regular pushups doesn’t do much for your ability to do one-arm pushups. (If you want to see this principle in action, check out &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiCqpMGItP8">this video&lt;/a> of a woman first squatting a barbell weighing over twice(!) her own bodyweight and then squatting a barbell weighing her own bodyweight 33 times. I’m sure she could easily do a couple hundred unloaded squats.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would also argue that strength has much more every-day applicability than endurance. When was the last time you had to run at a sustained effort for 30 minutes, outside an organized race? At least for me, that’s not something I encounter frequently (or ever). But carrying five-gallon water containers from the car, putting my luggage into the airplane overhead bin, moving furniture around while cleaning the house, those are things I do all the time. And every bit of strength I have makes those tasks easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img style="float: left; width: 50%; margin-right: 1em;" src="2013-10-01_121817.jpg">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the unique benefits of resistance training, one that cannot be realized any other way, is increased bone density. Bones strengthen when they are subjected to load, and they wither away in its absence. (Incidentally, that’s why astronauts experience &lt;a href="http://science1.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast01oct_1/">substantial loss of bone mass during extended stays in zero g.&lt;/a>) If you are young and engage in serious resistance training, you will build a strong skeletal structure that will serve you well for a life-time of activities. And if you are old and engage in serious resistance training, you will &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9927006">maintain and possibly even regain bone mass.&lt;/a> By contrast, if you don’t do any exercise at all, or the only exercise you ever do is riding a stationary bike, you will most certainly experience substantial bone loss as you age.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many people who are not familiar with weight lifting are concerned of the possible injury risks. They picture themselves crushed under a 200lb barbell and can’t imagine how anybody in their right mind would subject themselves to such a risk. However, weightlifting is fairly safe when done properly, i.e., with good form and using weights that are appropriate to the strength level of the athlete. Compared to other physical activities one could engage in (soccer, football, cycling on public roads), weightlifting does not cause more serious or more frequent injuries. Even among people who lift a lot and lift very heavy, any injuries that occur &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1322916/">are usually minor (&amp;lt;1 day of training missed).&lt;/a> In the elderly, strength training caused &lt;a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/1758297">about as many injuries as walking and many fewer than jogging.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only downside to heavy lifting is that you’ll look like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Nah, you won’t. Nobody looks like Arnold by accident. Not even Arnold. That look requires years of dedicated effort, very high-volume training, superior genetics, and the right pharmacological support. If you’re just a regular guy or gal going to the gym a few times a week, you’ll look fit, but you won’t look like the Michelin man.&lt;/p>

&lt;li id="fn1">&lt;p>For the purpose of this topic, we can safely assume that a person lifting weights in a gym is a man. There’s probably twenty guys lifting weights to one woman doing so. If you’re a woman who is seriously into lifting, I tip my hat to you, and you know what I’m talking about.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>
