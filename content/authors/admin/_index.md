Sevim Cengiz is a PhD candidate at Computational Imaging Lab (CIL) under the supervision of Dr. Esin Ozturk Isik.
My current research focuses on MRSI data analysis, super resolution of MRSI, and new deep learning techniques. 

My motivation for open-source has started when I met with GannetMask_Philips.m in Github. 
There is no need to reinvent the wheel. Read more, explore more, code more, enjoy more, love more.
